# 코딩 테스트 및 인터뷰를 위한 알고리즘 노트
##  Overview
>Build solid fundamentals and develop problem-solving skills<br>
>Always thinking about solving a problem and trying and trying again to solve the problem until the end<br>

01. 이코테(이것이 취업을 위한 코딩테스트이다): Study Fundamental & Solve Some Problems [Coding Test Book](https://github.com/Steve-YJ/Python-Algorithm/tree/main/01.%20%EC%9D%B4%EC%BD%94%ED%85%8C(%EC%9D%B4%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B4%20%EC%B7%A8%EC%97%85%EC%9D%84%20%EC%9C%84%ED%95%9C%20%EC%BD%94%EB%94%A9%ED%85%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EC%9D%B4%EB%8B%A4))
<br>(DFS/BFS, Greedy Algorithm, Implementation, Dynamic Programming, etc)

03. Code & Judge: Problem Solving Everyday with Codewars [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Steve-Lee)
<br>Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. 

04. Preparing Python Algorithm Interview: deep dive into Python and Python algorithm [LeetCode](https://github.com/Steve-YJ/Python-Algorithm/tree/main/02.%20Leetcode)

<br>

## Alogorithm Everyday
* [x] Codewars - Python, SQL Fundamentals
* [ ] LeetCode - solve one problem one day
* [ ] Theory & Study - (like habit) study whenever necessary

<br>

## 1. Codewars
> To me, it is not a codewars, but it is like code playground.<br>
> I solved more than 250 kata and ranked top 10%

## 2. LeetCode
> After codewar, I thought I needed change<br>
> It mean that I want to solve more difficult problems<br>
> That's why I started LeetCode.


## 3. BOJ (BaekJoon Online Judge)
> Just Started BOJ for Online Coding Test
> Solved almost 100 problems and ranked silver03 (2022.05.18)
> After soling 100 algorithm problems, I studing the theory again
